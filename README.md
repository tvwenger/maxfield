# Ingress Maxfield (v4.0)
## An [Ingress](https://ingress.com/) Linking and Fielding Strategy Generator

![Maxfield Demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvwenger/maxfield/master/example/plan_movie.gif?s=200)

### Introduction

This is for Ingress. If you don't know what that is, you're lost.

Maxfield is a tool that generates a linking and fielding plan for a
group of portals and a group of cooperating agents. Maxfield attempts
to **maximize** AP, **minimize** the number of keys required for any
one portal, and **minimize** to total time required to complete the
fielding operation.

Although generating an ideal (i.e. max AP) fielding plan is [fairly
straightforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=priezq6Dm4Y),
identifying the optimal order to create the links to minimize walking
is a [computationally challenging
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory).
Maxfield simplifies the problem by *approximating* the ideal linking
order: it generates many possible solutions and picks the best.

Since Maxfield generates random, nearly-ideal linking plans, you will
likely get a new plan every time you run the tool. Each plan will
almost certainly have the maximum possible AP, but the linking order
and walking distance may be different.

This version (v4.0) is a nearly complete re-write of the original
Maxfield code (based originally off of work by J. Peter Baker), which
brings Maxfield into the future with Python 3, fixes many bugs, and
improves the algorithm dramatically. Previous users of Maxfield will
notice that plans are now much more efficient in that they require
fewer keys from any individual portal, and the link order is more
sensible for multi-agent operations.

You can download this tool and run it locally on your computer by
following the instructions below. Or, you can use the on-line version
of this tool: http://www.ingress-maxfield.com

### Installation

Maxfield is written in Python 3 and is easy to install assuming
you have a Python environment on your computer. The `pygifsicle`
package depends on `gifsicle`, so you will need to install `gifsicle`.
Instructions can be [found here](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/).

Once that's done, installing Maxfield (tested on Linux) is as easy as:

	python setup.py install
	
Now you can run Maxfield using the command `maxfield-plan` at the
command line.

I am not too familiar with Python on Windows, but here is how I tested
an installation on Windows 10 in a virtual environment. I downloaded
this repository as a `.zip` and extracted the contents to 
`C:\Users\username\Documents\maxfield`

	cd C:\Users\username\Documents\maxfield
	"C:\Program Files\Python38\python.exe" -m venv env
	env\Scripts\activate
	pip install numpy networkx scipy ortools matplotlib imageio pygifsicle
	python setup.py install
	
Then, Maxfield can be launched on Windows from any folder via

	C:\Users\username\Documents\maxfield\env\Scripts\activate
	python C:\Users\username\Documents\maxfield\bin\maxfield-plan

N.B. There is a bug with the latest version of `ortools`, so we use
an older version. See: https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3202

## Run Using Docker

You can run Maxfield using Docker for a consistent and isolated environment. Follow these steps:

### Build the Docker Image

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tvwenger/maxfield.git
   cd maxfield
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t maxfield .
   ```

### Run Maxfield with Docker

To run Maxfield, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app maxfield ./example/example_portals.txt --num_agents 3 --verbose --output_csv 
```

### Explanation of Command

- `docker run --rm`: Run the container and remove it after execution.
- `-v $(pwd):/app`: Mount the current working directory into the container at `/app` so that input and output files are accessible.
- `maxfield`: The name of the Docker image.
- `./example/example_portals.txt`: The input file containing the list of portals.
- `--num_agents 3 --verbose --output_csv`: Example arguments to customize the operation.

### Output Files

The results will be saved in the current working directory (`$(pwd)`), including:

- **`key_preparation.txt`**: List of keys needed for each portal.
- **`agent_assignments.txt`**: Link assignments for each agent.
- **`link_map.png`**: Visual representation of links and fields.
- **`plan_movie.gif`**: Step-by-step animation of the linking plan.

### Notes

Ensure the `example_portals.txt` file is present in your working directory or specify its actual location when running the command.

### Example

The `example` directory includes the Maxfield output for the portal
list in `example/example_portals.txt`. These results were generated
with the following command:

	maxfield-plan example_portals.txt --num_agents 3 --num_cpus 0 --verbose --output_csv --google_api_key <REDACTED> --google_api_secret <REDACTED>
	
Here was the output from this command:

```

### Portal list format

The input to Maxfield is a file containing a list of portals and parameters about
those portals. The portal file is semi-colon delimited, with the
following format:

	Portal 1 Name; Portal 1 Intel URL; (optional) Number of Keys in Hand; (optional) SBUL
	
The file must contain one line with this format for each portal.
The first item on each line must be a portal name, and it **must not** contain
a semi-colon. 

The second item must be the Intel URL for the portal,
which looks like:

	https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439
	
To obtain the Intel URL for a portal, navigate to the portal on the
Intel map, click on the portal to open the portal information frame,
then click on the "link" button at the top-left of the website. This will
open a pane with the portal URL, which contains the "pll=" bit. Simply
copy and paste this URL into your portal file.

Following the URL, there are two optional items which can appear in
any order or not at all. One is a number, which is interpreted as the
number of keys you already have in hand for this portal. The other is
the string SBUL which indicates that the portal is fully deployed with
SBULs, and thus the maximum number of out-going links is 40 instead of
the normal 8.

A correctly formatted line in the portal file will look like one of
these:

	Catholic Church of the Holy Comforter; https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439
	Catholic Church of the Holy Comforter; https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439; 3
	Catholic Church of the Holy Comforter; https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439; 3; SBUL
	Catholic Church of the Holy Comforter; https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439; SBUL
	Catholic Church of the Holy Comforter; https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=38.031745,-78.478592&z=18&pll=38.031796,-78.479439; SBUL; 3
